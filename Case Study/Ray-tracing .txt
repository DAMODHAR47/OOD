Ray-tracing 
-------------
Ray-tracing is a technology for generating photo-realistic images from scene description data. Very advanced types of this 
technology have recently been used for creating quite a few, and very impressive, animated pictures (such as “Shrek", or 
“Nemo"). 

Imagine you have to realize a ray-tracer application. At the core of such an application is a data structure, which maintains 
and represents the scene graph or the “world". Objects can be very simple objects, which have a geometrically defined shape 
and a typically algorithmically defined material, but they can also be arbitrarily complex compositions of other objects. The 
scene graph is then repeatedly traversed to check for intersections with various optical rays. 


Expected output:
-----------------
Design a class structure, which can represent a scene graph where each scene is made of one more geometrically defined shape and each 
shape is further mode of one or more  geometrically defined shape.
